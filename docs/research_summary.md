# Drone Intelligence System - Phase 1 Research

## 1. Drone Use Cases in India
### Agriculture
- **Application**: Crop monitoring, pesticide spraying, fertigation.
- **Impact**: Covers hectares faster than manual methods; ensures targeted application.

### Logistics
- **Application**: Delivery of medical supplies and essentials.
- **Example**: "Medicine from the Sky" in Telangana (300+ successful trials).

### Infrastructure
- **Application**: Monitoring highways and railway inspections.
- **Mandate**: Used by NHAI and Indian Railways.

### Emergency & Surveillance
- **Application**: Disaster response, border patrol, topographical surveys.
- **Example**: "Trishul" drone for border surveillance.

## 2. Benefits, Drawbacks, and Risks
### Economic Benefits
- Reduces input costs by 18%–20%.
- Increases crop yields by 30%–100% via precision farming.

### Environmental Impact
- Lowers chemical usage by up to 50%.
- Conserves water by up to 90%.

### Safety Risks
- Technical failures can lead to incidents like pilot incapacitation or loss of control.

### Drawbacks
- High initial investment costs.
- Limited internet connectivity in rural areas.
- Reliance on imported components (sensors, chips).

## 3. Rules and Regulations (Drone Rules 2021)
### Airspace Zones (Digital Sky Platform)
- **Green Zone**: Up to 400 ft (120m). No permission needed for drones up to 500kg.
- **Yellow Zone**: Controlled airspace. Requires ATC permission.
- **Red Zone**: Strictly prohibited. Requires Central Govt authorization.

### Registration & Certification
- **UIN**: Unique Identification Number required for all drones (except Nano).
- **Remote Pilot License**: Required for commercial operations (valid for 10 years). Not needed for non-commercial micro-drones.

## 4. Business Scope and Market Trends
### Market Projections
- **Growth**: CAGR of ~24.4%.
- **Value**: Expected to reach USD 1.39 billion by 2030.

### Government Initiatives
- **PLI Scheme**: ₹1.2 billion budget for domestic manufacturing.
- **Namo Drone Didi**: Equipping 15,000 women-led SHGs with drones.
- **Drone Shakti**: Promoting "Drone-as-a-Service" (DrAAS).
